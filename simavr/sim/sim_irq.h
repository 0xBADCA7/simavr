/*
 * Internal IRQ system
 * 
 * This subsystem allow any piece of code to "register" a hook to be called when an IRQ is
 * raised. The IRQ definition is up to the module defining it, for example a IOPORT pin change
 * might be an IRQ in wich case any oiece of code can be notified when a pin has changed state
 * 
 * The notify hooks are chained, and duplicates are filtered out so you can't register a
 * notify hook twice on one particylar IRQ
 * 
 * IRQ calling order is not defined, so don't rely on it.
 * 
 * IRQ hook needs to be registered in reset() handlers, ie after all modules init() bits
 * have been called, to prevent race condition of the initialization order.
