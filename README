simavr -- a simple, lean and mean AVR simulator

http://gitorious.org/simavr

simavr is a new AVR simulator for linux, or any platform that uses avr-gcc. It uses 
avr-gcc own register definition to simplify creating new targets for supoortted AVR
devices.

The core was made to be small and compact, and hackable so allow quick prototyping 
of an AVR project. The simulator loads .elf directly, and there is even a way to
specify simulation parameters directly in the emulated code using an .elf section.

The status of the project is the core works fine now. The supported IOs are eeprom,
IO ports (including pin interupts), 8 bits timers (well, one of mode of the myriad),
SPI master & slave, and the UART with tx&rx interrupts.

gdb support is implemented and works great (minus watchpoints).

The supported AVR cores are in the simavr/cores directory. It's very simple to
add new devices if yours is not there.

There is also one example of how to integrate simavr core into your own program in the
"examples" directory.

PREQUISTES:
+ avr-gcc ; tested with 4.3.4 (from debian)
	The code rudely assumes the avr-gcc is in /usr/lib/avr/include/...
	On OSX, the Makefile tries to use the Arduino.app toolchain & headers
+ libelf-dev

BUILD:
+ make

TEST:
+ ./simavr/run_avr tests/atmega88_example.axf
